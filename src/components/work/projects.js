    'Swapify is a WYSIWYG editor that enables cleverbridge clients to customize their online shopping carts without coding experience. Users select a theme which they are then able to fully customize, from changing fonts, colors, and layouts to swaping out entire shopping cart components such as payment options and order steps. Swapify makes creating and testing different design patterns a breeze, making sales demos more effective and relevant, enabling painless A/B testing for analytics teams, and generally allowing clients to find the pattern thatâ€™s best for their conversion.',
